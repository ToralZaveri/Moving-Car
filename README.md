# Moving-Car

Abstract:
- This project aims to create a moving car in javafx. Javafx has better
libraries for graphics, so we did not use any other libraries.
- The steps to completing this project involved creating a car,
movement of the car and adding some buttons to move the car like,
Pause, Resume, Increase, and Decrease.
- The Pause button would pause the car. After pausing the car, press
the resume button to resume at the regular speed.
- The Increase and Decrease buttons will change the speed of the car
accordingly.
Implementation:
Design a car:
Pane is the easy set up and management of classic layout.
The car has been created by using “pane”.
W and h is the width and height of the pane.
Motion of the car:
Using a for loop on tires, the car moves continuously in a straight direction
with the normal speed.
Adding the buttons:
Using HBox, we have added some buttons in alignment.
Using .setOnAction, it will allow the action to set.
For example, We have used pause.setOnAction for pause button.
Because of it, the car would pause.
Result:
After running the code, the car would move in a straight direction. By
pressing the buttons, the car would change its speed.
* I have attached a video in the folder.
Conclusion:
- Successfully worked through the project with javafx
- Completed all the objectives
- We managed to add the buttons to change the movement of the car
